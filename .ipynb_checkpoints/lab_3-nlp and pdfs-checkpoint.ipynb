       "\"Executive Summary B1 Adapting to an Unprecedented Pandemic  and Preparing for the ﬁNext Normalﬂ The COVID19 pandemic has caused a national recession, a sudden reduction in state and local revenues, and severe economic distress for businesses, families, community organizations and public agencies.  It has jeopardized the health of our communities and our economic livelihood.  As of the writing of the Recommended Budget, the County is still under the State Public Health Officer's ﬁStayatHomeﬂ Order, with very limited easing of restrictions.   In preparing this Recommended Budget, which began in November 2019 and was completed in early May to meet statutory requirements for public review, we lacked complete information on the extent and severity of the disruption to the County's Budget.  The Governor's May Revise of the State's budget demonstrates a deficit of $54.3 billion, and it will be several more months before the specific impact to our budget is known.  While the pandemic has caused seismic changes to our daily lives and economy, it is impossible to answer with certainty the essential questions of ﬁfor how longﬂ and ﬁhow severeﬂ from where we stand today. In the California Legislative Analyst's Office's Spring Fiscal Outlook Report, released in midMay, two scenarios are suggested: a ﬁUﬂshaped recession, where the economy would begin to see meaningful recovery this summer, with rapid activity beginning in the second half of 2021; and an ﬁLﬂshaped recession, where the economy would remain in a slump well into 2021 with gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2021.  The information in this Recommended Budget is based on assumptions that projected revenue losses, beginning in spring 2020 of the current year, continue in key local and State revenues through the first quarter of the upcoming fiscal year and taper down through the remainder of the fiscal year.  In addition, conservative estimates of funding have been assumed.    Our objectives have been to maintain current service levels to the extent possible (ﬁstatus quoﬂ levels of service) so as not to further harm members of our community; continue to fulfill Board commitments and priorities; and invest in initiatives that will help mitigate recessionary impacts and prepare for the next normal and recovery.  In this vein, cannabis tax revenue is being utilized to fill certain gaps created by increased COVID19 related expenditures and temporary decreases in key revenues.  In addition, onetime sourcesŠsuch as the County's Strategic ReserveŠare recommended to be used to support expenditures in certain areas to preserve service levels.  With the current level of uncertainty, combined with sufficient onetime revenue for backfilling losses and covering new costs, few ongoing budget reductions are recommended at this time.  However, the CEO's office intends to return to the Board in the fall with potential ongoing budget reductions to be taken at midyear should they be necessary.It is also worth noting that while all organizations are facing similar challenges, county governments are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic, expanding and intensifying health, public safety and safety net services, and leading emergency operations countywide.  Public Health employees have been working around the clock in this crisis, and at their side have been employees from almost every County department serving in various capacities to protect our residents. The total impact to the County for lost revenues and additional costs are estimated at $25.1 million in the FY 201920 year and $27.3 million in FY 202021, for a total of $52.4 million.  The County will seek FEMA reimbursement (75% allowed) where feasible, but the County has not yet received any direct funding from the federal government for COVID19 impacts or costs (although the Governor's May Revise proposes passing through funding for this purpose). \""
