       "\"Executive Summary B3 both countywide discretionary revenues and departmentspecific revenues, expansion requests that would require ongoing General Fund commitmentŠsome of which might otherwise have been warrantedŠare not being recommended for funding at this time.  Departments have submitted requests for General Fund budget expansions totaling $12.7 million in ongoing funding, $4.3 million in onetime funds, and additional staffing of 59.5 FTE.  Requests for use of cannabis tax revenue total $1.5 million in ongoing funding, $341,000 in onetime funding, and 8.0 additional positions.Adherence to budget development policies continue. These policies were adopted by the Board in December and set guidelines for departments to follow while developing their budget requests.  Some policies called for contributions to reserve accounts for specific purposes, and the recommended budget reflects those allocations:o$500,000 has been set aside for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) improvements.  The County maintains a rolling fiveyear prioritized list of improvements that need to be made within Countyowned facilities to enhance the County's compliance with the ADA.o$2,000,000 has been set aside in the Technology Replacement and Investment Fund to address critical countywide and multidepartmental information technology project needs.  In FY 201920, the adopted budget established a Technology Replacement and Investment Fund account with an initial $2.0 million contribution.  The intent of this account is to address the growing need for updated technology infrastructure, security, and data storage capabilities across the County.  This need is greater than ever as the COVID19 pandemic has accelerated the transition to digital and online solutions.Maintain strong reserves to weather current year and future year losses in discretionary revenues.  Our Strategic Reserve and Contingencies accounts are our first lines of defense against unanticipated State budget impacts, COVID19 impacts, and a recession.  Although we had hoped to increase the Strategic Reserve balance to 9% of the annual General Fund operating budget to prepare for a future recession, we are unable to recommend this increase in FY 202021 because $3.8 million from the account is needed to backfill a portion of Social Services Realignment revenue losses.  This draw is offset by a $3.1 million contribution back to the account, which will bring the balance up to the 7.6% level.  A $2 million increase in the Contingencies account balance is also recommended, to bring the balance to $5 million from $3 million in the current year. Essential Priorities and Commitments for the Future In FY 201920, major milestones will have been met: the Northern Branch Jail construction is nearly complete; the Fire Tax Shift will reach its funding target of 17% of property tax revenues; the Tajiguas Resource Recovery project will make significant progress in construction; pension costsharing resulted in a net reduction to pension contribution costs, and will be fully implemented next year after three years; and major capital improvement projects received funding.In the next few years, as we navigate the recession caused by the pandemic, the County will need to focus on the essential priorities of health and safety, and ways to position the County in the ﬁnext normalﬂ or life after the pandemic, through revenue enhancement, cost savings, and new ways of operating.  The following are initiatives that were established in the prior years that will be continued or implemented in FY 202021:Northern Branch Jail will commence operations.  The construction of the Northern Branch Jail is expected to be completed in the summer of 2020, with operations commencing by midyear.  The annualized operating cost is currently estimated at $20.4 million, and includes staffing costs to operate and maintain the facility, as well as costs for inmate medical services, food, utilities, and other necessities.
